working on dns:
* display framework seems solid
* template looks ok in theory
* need to actually generate records
* need to create a "write out dns"  that will run by default on the daemon server
* need to create dns addendum manipulation methods

convert moar modules
maybe, if feeling brave, convert server add/delete/etc.
