### working on dns
* figure out the nsmaster stuff
* write display_rev to display reverse zones
* need to create a "write out dns"  that will run by default on the daemon server and write to bind
* need to create dns addendum manipulation methods

### post-dns
* convert moar modules
* maybe, if feeling brave, convert server add/delete/etc.
