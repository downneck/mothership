1. CORE DEPENDENCIES
=========================

A. Python

Mothership is written in Python and thus, requires Python to be installed.
All other tasks assume that you have Python installed.  To install the latest
version of python you can try:

CentOS 5.x: 
host#> sudo yum install python


OS X:
Ensure you have Xcode and Macports installed.  The following will setup
mothership core dependencies using Python 2.6. This setup assumes
that you have both Xcode and Macports installed.

To install Xcode please see the apple developer site here: 
http://http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html

To install Macports see the Macports project page here:
http://http://www.macports.org/

Once you have Macports and Xcode installed, you can do the following:
host#> sudo port install python26
host#> sudo port install python_select  
(python_select allows the override of the default python installation in OSX)


B. Checking for Core Dependencies

Mothership provides a python script that checks for the core dependencies,
depcheck.py. This script is located in the directory you unpacked the 
mothership files into.  To run the script you can do:

host#> python depchecker.py

This script will check if the dependencies necessary for mothership are
installed on your system.  If any are not installed, the script will note which
dependencies are not present.  You can skip to the subsection below for
information on how to install those dependencies.


C. Python Libraries

Mothership requires the following python libraries to be installed.

* sqlalchemy0.5
* psycopg2 
* setuptools
* pip
* cmdln (for pip)

To install the latest version of these you can try: 

CentOS 5.x:
host#> sudo yum install python-sqlalchemy0.5
host#> sudo yum install python-psycopg2
host#> sudo yum install python-setuptools
host#> sudo yum install python-pip
host#> sudo pip install cmdln

OS X:
host#> sudo port install py26-yaml
host#> sudo port install py26-sqlalchemy
host#> sudo port install py26-pip
host#> sudo port install py26-psycopg2
host#> sudo pip-2.6 install cmdln


D. Cobbler

Cobbler is an automation framework that aids in system installations. For more
information go to the Cobbler project site here:
http://https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/

To install the latest version you can try:

CentOS 5.x:
host#> sudo yum install cobbler

(Note: This will install the latest available rpm.  If you would like to
install cobbler from source, or just want more information on configuration
options please refer to the project page above.)

OS X:
To install cobbler for OS X, please refer to the documentation on the project
page above.



2. INSTALL THE DATABASE ENGINE

Mothership does not need its own database engine installation.
If you already have postgresql or mysql installed, feel free to skip
this section.

After the DB engine install, you will have to import the mothership database 
schema into your database, which is covered below in section 3.

A. Postgresql

  For a complete installation guide to PostgreSQL, you can go to the project
  page at http://www.postgresql.org or refer to your OS vendor documentation

  If you do not have postgresql installed at all, and wish to just 
  get up and running quickly, you can do the following:

  CentOS 5.3:
  host#> sudo yum install postgresql
  host#> sudo yum install postgresql-server

  (NOTE: This is a very minimal install, but still useful for testing.  
  If you are planning on using mothership and postgresql in a production 
  environment, it might be best to refer to the postgresql documentation 
  listed above.)

  OS X:
  Postgresql currently maintains a binary installer for OS X.  It can be found
  here:
  http://http://www.postgresql.org/download/


B. MySQL

  For a complete installation guide to MySQL, you can go to the project page
  at http://dev.mysql.com or refer to your OS vendor documentation

  CentOS 5.3:
  host#> sudo yum install mysql
  host#> sudo yum install mysql-server

  Ubuntu, Debian:
  host#> sudo aptitude install mysql 
  host#> sudo aptitude install mysql-server


3. INITIALIZING THE DATABASE 
Both the mothership database and its schema need to be added.

A. Postgresql

  1. Create a database named 'mothership' in postgresql:
  host#> /usr/bin/createdb mothership

  2. Create a postgresql user:
  host#> /usr/bin/createuser mothership

  3. Load the schema into the mothership database:
  host#> /usr/bin/psql -U mothership mothership < /<mothership_base_dir>/db/mothership_schema_postgres.sql

B. MySQL
  
  All instructions assume you've set a mysql root user password
  (and that you remember it)

  1. Create a database named 'mothership' in mysql:
  host#> mysqladmin -u root -p create mothership

  2. Create a mysql user:
  host#> mysql -u root -p mysql
  Enter password:
  mysql> GRANT ALL ON mothership.* to 'mothership'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';  

  Add additional GRANT statements to allow access to the mothership database
  from other hosts as needed

  3. Load the schema into the database:
  host#> mysql -u mothership -p mothership < /<mothership_base_dir>/db/mothership_schema_mysql.sql


4. INSTALL SYSTEM MANAGEMENT TOOL
Mothership functions best when used in conjunction with a system managment
tool.  This allows the system managment tool to take advanteage of the roles
assigned to systems in mothership, and the administrator to create rulesets
that automatically configure systems based on these roles.

Currently, the only system managment tool available to use with mothership
is puppet. When plugins for other system management tools are created, we will
add setup instructions accordingly.

5. CONFIGURATION TASKS

This section describes the tasks needed to preform a basic configuration of
mothership.


A. Cobbler

  The following Settings should be configured in cobblers configuration file,
  usually located in /etc/cobbler/settings:

  * manage_dhcp - Set this value to 1
  * manage_dns - Set this value to 1
  * next_server - Set this to the IP address of mothership
  * server - Set this to the IP address of mothership
  * manage_forward_zones - Add dns zones to be managed here
     ex. If you have DNS zone named 'example.com' then you would
     add an entry named 'example.com'
  * manage_reverse_zones - Add reverse DNS zones to be managed here
     ex. If you have an IP subnet 192.168.1.0/24 then you would add
     an entry named '192.168.1'

B. Mothership

  A sample configuration file is included in the mothership base directory,
  called "mothership.yaml.sample".  This can be used as a baseline to 
  create the configuration file for your site.

  By default mothership looks for its configuration file as:
  /etc/mothership.yaml

  The configuration file is ment to be self documenting. You should take a 
  look through this file and adjust any of the configuration settings 
  you need for your installation.



6. INSTALLING OPTIONAL SUBCOMPONENTS

The components below add functionality to mothership, but are not required for
a basic mothership installation.  If you do not require the functionality of a
subcomponent, you can safely skip its installation.

A. Zabbix

  This subcomponent provides a way to interface with the Zabbix monitoring
  solution.  By default, the use of this subcomponent is turned off in
  mothership, so that this subcomponent not required. For more information on
  installing and configuring Zabbix itself, consult the Zabbix web site here:
  http://www.zabbix.com/

  To install The Zabix module in mothership, you do the following:

  1. Install the Pyton hashlib library

  CentOS 5.x:
  host#> sudo yum install python-hashlib

  OS X:
  hashlib should be included by default in python 2.6.  For information on
  installing python26, please see the OS X python section above.


  2. Download and install the Zabbix API
  The Zabbix API suite is not maintained or provided by mothership.  It is
  provided and maintained by Zabbix. The current version can be downloaded here:
  https://www.zulukilo.com/svn/pub/zabbix-api/trunk/zabbix_api2.py

  That file should be copied into the mothership base directory as
  "zabbix_api.py"  Permissions should be set to "-rw-rw-r--" (664).

  3. Enable zabbix integration in mothership.yaml config
  Edit your mothership configuration file. (in either /etc/mothership.yaml for
  global configurations, or ~/.mothership.yaml for local user configurations)
  In the section under "Zabbix Options" set:

  active:true
